00:00.000 --> 00:17.840
 As our vision is to create a world where every disease is treatable, it is very crucial to

00:17.840 --> 00:22.640
 provide the best tools to make it easier for scientists to achieve that.

00:22.640 --> 00:27.120
 To treat all the diseases out there, what we have to do is we have to address targets

00:27.120 --> 00:28.960
 that are challenging.

00:28.960 --> 00:34.240
 It's not enough anymore to just address targets that are simple to handle, simple to analyze.

00:34.240 --> 00:38.000
 Drug discovery projects are getting more and more challenging, especially the molecules

00:38.000 --> 00:39.000
 involved.

00:39.000 --> 00:45.400
 Hence, new methods are needed and mostly these are our physical methods to address exactly

00:45.400 --> 00:47.200
 those challenging interactions.

00:47.200 --> 00:53.120
 There's a class of proteins, intrinsically this order of proteins, that are highly aggregation

00:53.120 --> 00:59.320
 from. When you study such proteins in solution, you are always facing the threat of these

00:59.320 --> 01:02.120
 proteins aggregating.

01:02.120 --> 01:08.040
 Hence you need a method that would deliver high quality data, even in presence of aggregates.

01:08.040 --> 01:12.360
 The new diameters with Spectral Shift implemented delivers exactly that.

01:12.360 --> 01:18.080
 It delivers very robust and high quality data, even in presence of aggregates.

01:18.080 --> 01:27.760
 But our precision is just amazing, it's shifts of 0.1 nanometer, we can resolve with a huge

01:27.760 --> 01:28.760
 resolution.

01:28.760 --> 01:35.640
 We have now the power as a scientist, the users' tools, to make this untrugable target,

01:35.640 --> 01:41.680
 once we tried it on more and more challenging interactions, we were really surprised and

01:41.680 --> 01:44.720
 amazed by the quality of data that we got.

01:44.720 --> 01:48.920
 Whatever plans we had, this is so great we just have to do it.

01:48.920 --> 01:52.240
 I think I've never been so excited the last 10 years.

01:52.240 --> 01:57.120
 To tackle these most challenging targets, it's really important for us to provide tools

01:57.120 --> 01:59.680
 that are easy to use for our customers.

01:59.680 --> 02:04.880
 So they shouldn't think about how to use it, how to analyze the data, how to optimize

02:04.880 --> 02:06.480
 the assay that it works.

02:06.480 --> 02:09.160
 They should just put their sample in and then it works.

02:09.160 --> 02:12.320
 And the Spectral Shift technology actually offered exactly this.

02:12.320 --> 02:16.400
 When we had this data, the first data in our hands, we said that's it, we have to make

02:16.400 --> 02:43.360
 it available to our customers.
