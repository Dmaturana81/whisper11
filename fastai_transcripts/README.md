In this directory there are notebooks and scripts that demo how we built the [YouTube Search App](https://share.streamlit.io/pinecone-io/playground/yt-search/src/server.py).

* **00_data_build.ipynb** shows how we used the Kaggle YTTTS dataset with Beautiful Soup and other libraries to create the data used in the app.
* **01_pinecone_yt_search.ipynb** demonstrates the indexing and querying used to populate and query the index.
* **app.py** is the Streamlit script powering the app itself.

You can read more about this project in our article [Making YouTube Search Better with NLP](https://pinecone.io/learn/youtube-search).
