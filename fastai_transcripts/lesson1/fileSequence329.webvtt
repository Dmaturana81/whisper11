01:22:14.560 --> 01:22:22.100
 So all of this is to say, have a go at starting something,

01:22:22.100 --> 01:22:24.600
 create something you think would be fun or interesting

01:22:24.600 --> 01:22:26.320
 and share it in the forum.

01:22:26.320 --> 01:22:29.480
 If you're a total beginner with Python,

01:22:29.480 --> 01:22:31.200
 then start with something simple.
