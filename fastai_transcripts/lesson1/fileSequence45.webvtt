X-TIMESTAMP-MAP=MPEGTS:900000,LOCAL:00:00:00.000

00:11:14.400 --> 00:11:18.040
 so this model just took the text as input

00:11:18.040 --> 00:11:21.520
 and created this text as output.

00:11:21.520 --> 00:11:25.880
 And so you can see, again, deep learning models,

00:11:25.880 --> 00:11:29.400
 doing things which I think very few, if any of us would

00:11:29.400 --> 00:11:32.040
 have believed, would be maybe possible to do
