01:07:27.400 --> 01:07:31.600
 every time we change one of our notebooks,

01:07:31.600 --> 01:07:37.080
 hundreds of tests get run automatically in parallel.

01:07:37.080 --> 01:07:40.800
 And if there's any issues, we will find out about it.

01:07:40.800 --> 01:07:42.080
 So yeah, notebooks are great.

01:07:42.080 --> 01:07:51.520
 And RISE is a really nice way to do slides in notebooks.
