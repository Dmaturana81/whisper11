01:08:29.120 --> 01:08:30.840
 some of the first open source software

01:08:30.840 --> 01:08:33.800
 that would run on GPUs.

01:08:33.800 --> 01:08:36.080
 But yeah, I mean, despite the fact that today there's

01:08:36.080 --> 01:08:37.520
 a lot of people talking about deep learning,

01:08:37.520 --> 01:08:39.560
 we're just scratching the surface.

01:08:39.560 --> 01:08:41.680
 Every time, pretty much somebody says to me,

01:08:41.680 --> 01:08:45.160
