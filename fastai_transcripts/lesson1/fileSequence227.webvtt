00:56:42.640 --> 00:56:45.800
 and sorry, very little code required.

00:56:45.800 --> 00:56:49.280
 And the steps are actually going to look quite familiar.

00:56:49.280 --> 00:56:52.400
 In fact, in this case, we're using an even simpler approach.

00:56:52.400 --> 00:56:54.160
 Earlier on, we used data blocks.

00:56:54.160 --> 00:57:02.600
 Data blocks are a intermediate level, very flexible approach
