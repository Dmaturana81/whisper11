00:56:26.960 --> 00:56:30.120
 to solve it not amazingly well, but pretty well.

00:56:30.120 --> 00:56:33.040
 If I had trained it for another two minutes,

00:56:33.040 --> 00:56:35.680
 it'd probably be close to perfect.

00:56:35.680 --> 00:56:37.280
 So this is called segmentation.

00:56:37.280 --> 00:56:42.640
 Now, you'll see that there's very, very little data required,

00:56:42.640 --> 00:56:45.800
 and sorry, very little code required.
