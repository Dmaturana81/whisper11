00:50:44.040 --> 00:50:45.040
 to integrate this.

00:50:45.040 --> 00:50:49.280
 So you can use any one of the PyTorch image models.

00:50:49.280 --> 00:50:51.200
 And one of our students, Amana Mora,

00:50:51.200 --> 00:50:56.120
 was kind enough to create this fantastic documentation

00:50:56.120 --> 00:50:59.800
 where you can find out all about the different models.
