X-TIMESTAMP-MAP=MPEGTS:900000,LOCAL:00:00:00.000

00:03:43.680 --> 00:03:45.960
 sounds like a good starting point.

00:03:45.960 --> 00:03:49.440
 So I go through each of forest and bird,

00:03:49.440 --> 00:03:53.840
 and I search for forest photo and bird photo,

00:03:53.840 --> 00:03:57.120
 download images, and then resize them

00:03:57.120 --> 00:04:00.560
 to be no bigger than 400 pixels on a side,
