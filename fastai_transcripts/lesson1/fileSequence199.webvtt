 The critical concept here in Fast.AI is called a learner.

00:49:46.400 --> 00:49:50.160
 A learner is something which combines a model,

00:49:50.160 --> 00:49:52.440
 which is that is the actual neural network function

00:49:52.440 --> 00:49:56.360
 we'll be training, and the data we use to train it with.

00:49:56.360 --> 00:49:59.160
 And that's why you have to pass in two things.

00:49:59.160 --> 00:50:05.400
 The data, which is the data loaders object, and a model.
