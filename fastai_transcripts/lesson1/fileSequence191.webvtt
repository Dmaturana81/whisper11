00:47:42.040 --> 00:47:46.680
 We call it a batch or a mini batch.

00:47:46.680 --> 00:47:52.760
 And so when we say show batch, that's actually

00:47:52.760 --> 00:47:53.920
 a very specific word.

00:47:53.920 --> 00:47:56.760
 And deep learning, it's saying show me an example

00:47:56.760 --> 00:48:00.720
 of a batch of data that you would be passing into the model.
