X-TIMESTAMP-MAP=MPEGTS:900000,LOCAL:00:00:00.000

01:17:14.000 --> 01:17:16.280
 And so once we've done that, we now

01:17:16.280 --> 01:17:19.280
 have something which puts them through a model

01:17:19.280 --> 01:17:21.720
 and gives us results.

01:17:21.720 --> 01:17:27.160
 It looks exactly like our original idea of a program.

01:17:27.160 --> 01:17:30.880
 And that's why we can do what I described earlier.
