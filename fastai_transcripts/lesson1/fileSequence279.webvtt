01:09:47.520 --> 01:09:49.400
 if it looks like a good board or not,

01:09:49.400 --> 01:09:53.600
 even if it needs to be an expert human,

01:09:53.600 --> 01:09:56.560
 then that's probably something that deep learning will

01:09:56.560 --> 01:09:58.480
 be pretty good at.

01:09:58.480 --> 01:10:02.320
