01:00:28.080 --> 01:00:32.160
 we do as always something underscore learner.

01:00:32.160 --> 01:00:35.280
 In this case, it's a tabular learner.

01:00:35.280 --> 01:00:37.600
 Now, this time we don't say fine tune.

01:00:37.600 --> 01:00:40.840
 We say fit, specifically fit one cycle.

01:00:40.840 --> 01:00:42.680
 That's because for tabular models,

01:00:42.680 --> 01:00:44.920
 there's not generally going to be a pre trained model

01:00:44.920 --> 01:00:47.200
 that already does something like what you want,
