00:07:29.920 --> 00:07:31.600
 And I thought this was an amazing thing

00:07:31.600 --> 00:07:35.040
 that this guy, Nick, did, where he took his friends Twitter

00:07:35.040 --> 00:07:39.920
 bios and typed them into the Dali 2 input,

00:07:39.920 --> 00:07:42.360
 and it generated these pictures.

00:07:42.360 --> 00:07:44.800
 So this guy's, he typed in commitment, sympathetic,

00:07:44.800 --> 00:07:48.960
 psychedelic, philosophical, and it generated these pictures.
