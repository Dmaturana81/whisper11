01:14:58.640 --> 01:15:04.200
 And by a bit better, we mean it should make the loss get

01:15:04.200 --> 01:15:05.040
 a little bit better.

01:15:05.040 --> 01:15:09.360
 So we've got this number that says how good is our model?

01:15:09.360 --> 01:15:11.000
 And initially, it's terrible, right?

01:15:11.000 --> 01:15:12.400
 It's random.

01:15:12.400 --> 01:15:16.000
 We need some mechanism if making a little bit better.
