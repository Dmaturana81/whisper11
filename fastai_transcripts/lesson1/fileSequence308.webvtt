01:16:58.800 --> 01:17:04.280
 And so once we've finished that training procedure,

01:17:04.280 --> 01:17:06.960
 we don't need the loss anymore.

01:17:06.960 --> 01:17:08.680
 And even the weights themselves, we

01:17:08.680 --> 01:17:10.960
 can integrate them into the model.

01:17:10.960 --> 01:17:13.240
 We've finished changing them, so we can just say that's now

01:17:13.240 --> 01:17:14.000
 fixed.

01:17:14.000 --> 01:17:16.280
 And so once we've done that, we now
