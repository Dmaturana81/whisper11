00:25:43.680 --> 00:25:47.520
 You just start with actually a random neural network

00:25:47.520 --> 00:25:51.080
 and you feed it examples and you have a learn

00:25:51.080 --> 00:25:53.160
 to recognize things.

00:25:53.160 --> 00:25:55.120
 And it turns out that these are the things

00:25:55.120 --> 00:25:58.560
 that it creates for itself.

00:25:58.560 --> 00:26:03.480
 So you can then combine these features.
