01:19:29.360 --> 01:19:32.760
 Maybe try to use three or four categories, rather than two.

01:19:32.760 --> 01:19:34.360
 Have a think about something that you think

01:19:34.360 --> 01:19:38.800
 would be fun to try.

01:19:38.800 --> 01:19:42.920
 Depending on where you're at, push yourself a little bit,

01:19:42.920 --> 01:19:43.720
 but not too much.

01:19:43.720 --> 01:19:45.520
 So make sure you get something finished
