00:05:58.520 --> 00:06:00.800
 And believe it or not, that's enough

00:06:00.800 --> 00:06:07.000
 to finish doing the thing, which was in that XKCD comic.

00:06:07.000 --> 00:06:11.160
 Let's check by passing in that bird that we downloaded

00:06:11.160 --> 00:06:12.360
 at the start.

00:06:12.360 --> 00:06:14.400
 This is a bird.

00:06:14.400 --> 00:06:16.360
 Probability is a bird.
