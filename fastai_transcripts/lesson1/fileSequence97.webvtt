00:24:14.240 --> 00:24:19.760
 And so what actually happened was, in I think it was 2015,

00:24:19.760 --> 00:24:24.440
 Matt Zyla and Rob Fergus took a trained neural network

00:24:24.440 --> 00:24:27.960
 and they looked inside it to see what it had learned.

00:24:27.960 --> 00:24:33.480
 So we don't give it features, we ask it to learn features.
