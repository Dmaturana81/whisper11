 So on Kaggle, if you start with somebody else's Notebook,

00:35:31.560 --> 00:35:35.640
 so why don't you start with this one, Jupyter Notebook 101.

00:35:35.640 --> 00:35:38.000
 If it's your own Notebook, you'll see a button called edit.

00:35:38.000 --> 00:35:42.480
 If it's somebody else's, that button will say copy and edit.

00:35:42.480 --> 00:35:44.920
 If you use somebody's Notebook that you like,

00:35:44.920 --> 00:35:46.560
 make sure you click the upvote button
