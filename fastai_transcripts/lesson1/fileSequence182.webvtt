00:45:26.640 --> 00:45:30.400
 is that it's critical that you put aside some data

00:45:30.400 --> 00:45:32.480
 for testing the accuracy of your model.

00:45:32.480 --> 00:45:35.400
 And that's called a validation set.

00:45:35.400 --> 00:45:37.920
 It's so critical that Fast.DI won't let

00:45:37.920 --> 00:45:40.840
 you train a model without one.

00:45:40.840 --> 00:45:43.560
 So you actually have to tell it how to create a validation set,

00:45:43.560 --> 00:45:45.320
 how to set aside some data.
