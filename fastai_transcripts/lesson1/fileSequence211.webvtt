00:52:41.440 --> 00:52:45.000
 is this fine tune method, which what it does

00:52:45.000 --> 00:52:48.200
 is it takes those pre trained weights we downloaded for you

00:52:48.200 --> 00:52:52.680
 and it adjusts them in a really carefully controlled way

00:52:52.680 --> 00:52:58.960
 to just teach the model the differences between your dataset

00:52:58.960 --> 00:53:00.960
 and what it was originally trained for.
