X-TIMESTAMP-MAP=MPEGTS:900000,LOCAL:00:00:00.000

00:35:59.160 --> 00:36:02.920
 And to use it, we can type in any arbitrary expression

00:36:02.920 --> 00:36:06.040
 in Python and click run.

00:36:06.040 --> 00:36:08.240
 And the very first time we do that, it says session is

00:36:08.240 --> 00:36:10.920
 starting, it's basically launching a virtual computer

00:36:10.920 --> 00:36:12.920
 for us to run our code.

00:36:12.920 --> 00:36:15.920
 This is all free.
