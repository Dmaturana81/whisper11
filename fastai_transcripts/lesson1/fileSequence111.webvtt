00:27:43.160 --> 00:27:45.160
 they would try classifying sounds.

00:27:45.160 --> 00:27:48.600
 And so they basically took sounds and created pictures

00:27:48.600 --> 00:27:50.680
 from their waveforms.

00:27:50.680 --> 00:27:52.840
 And then they used an image recognizer on that.

00:27:52.840 --> 00:27:56.240
 And they got a state of the art result, by the way.

00:27:56.240 --> 00:27:57.960
 Another of our students on the forum

00:27:57.960 --> 00:28:01.760
 said that they did something very similar to take time series
