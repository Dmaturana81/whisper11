01:00:58.880 --> 01:01:02.240
 So that's why it generally doesn't make too much sense

01:01:02.240 --> 01:01:03.960
 to fine tune a tabular model.

01:01:03.960 --> 01:01:06.640
 So instead, you just fit.

01:01:06.640 --> 01:01:09.280
 So there is one difference there.

01:01:09.280 --> 01:01:12.600
 I'll show another example.

01:01:12.600 --> 01:01:13.960
 OK.

01:01:13.960 --> 01:01:15.120
 So collaborative filtering.
