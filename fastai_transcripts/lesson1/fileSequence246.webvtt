 that says which users liked which products or which users

01:01:33.880 --> 01:01:35.640
 used which products.

01:01:35.640 --> 01:01:39.840

01:01:39.840 --> 01:01:42.640
 might like based on finding similar users

01:01:42.640 --> 01:01:44.960
 and what those similar users liked.

01:01:44.960 --> 01:01:46.800
