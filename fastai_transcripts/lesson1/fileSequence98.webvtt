00:24:27.960 --> 00:24:33.480
 So we don't give it features, we ask it to learn features.

00:24:33.480 --> 00:24:36.240
 So when Zyla and Fergus looked inside a neural network,

00:24:36.240 --> 00:24:42.440
 they looked at the actual weights in the model

00:24:42.440 --> 00:24:43.800
 and they drew a picture of them.

00:24:43.800 --> 00:24:47.240
 And this was nine of the sets of weights they found.
