00:25:13.920 --> 00:25:18.880
 features and combine them to create more advanced features.

00:25:18.880 --> 00:25:20.920
 So these are some layer two features.

00:25:20.920 --> 00:25:24.120
 So there's a feature, for example, that finds corners

00:25:24.120 --> 00:25:26.520
 and a feature that finds curves and a feature that finds

00:25:26.520 --> 00:25:27.520
 circles.

00:25:27.520 --> 00:25:30.000
 Now, here are some examples of bits of pictures
