00:23:44.440 --> 00:23:47.520
 So this project took years and a lot of people

00:23:47.520 --> 00:23:49.720
 and a lot of code and a lot of math.

00:23:49.720 --> 00:23:52.200
 And then once they had all these features,

00:23:52.200 --> 00:23:54.240
 they then fed them into a machine learning model,

00:23:54.240 --> 00:23:57.640
 in this case, logistic progression to predict survival.

00:23:57.640 --> 00:24:00.120
 As I say, it's very successful.
