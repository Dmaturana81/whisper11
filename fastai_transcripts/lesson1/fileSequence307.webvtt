01:16:41.560 --> 01:16:45.520
 then and use the neural network as a model,

01:16:45.520 --> 01:16:47.120
 then we're good to go.

01:16:47.120 --> 01:16:51.400
 In theory, we can solve anything given enough time

01:16:51.400 --> 01:16:53.880
 and enough data.

01:16:53.880 --> 01:16:58.800
 And so that's exactly what we do.

01:16:58.800 --> 01:17:04.280
 And so once we've finished that training procedure,
