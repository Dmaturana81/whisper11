00:38:43.280 --> 00:38:46.520
 that I'm using the most recent version of any software.

00:38:46.520 --> 00:38:49.680
 So my first cell here is exclamation mark

00:38:49.680 --> 00:38:51.400
 pip install minus u.

00:38:51.400 --> 00:38:54.560
 That means upgrade, queue for quiet, fast di.

00:38:54.560 --> 00:38:57.440
 So that makes sure that we have the latest version of fast di.

00:38:57.440 --> 00:38:59.640
 And if you always have that at the start of your notebooks,

00:38:59.640 --> 00:39:02.440
 you're never going to have those awkward foreign threads
