 said that they did something very similar to take time series

00:28:01.760 --> 00:28:06.400
 and turn them into pictures and then use image classifiers.

00:28:06.400 --> 00:28:09.440
 Another of our students created pictures

00:28:09.440 --> 00:28:14.320
 from mouse movements, from users of a computer system.

00:28:14.320 --> 00:28:18.040
 So the clicks became dots and the movements became lines.
