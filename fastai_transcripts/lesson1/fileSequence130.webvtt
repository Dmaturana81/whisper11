00:32:28.560 --> 00:32:30.400
 The problem of writing lots of code

00:32:30.400 --> 00:32:32.760
 is that that's lots of things to make mistakes with,

00:32:32.760 --> 00:32:36.400

00:32:36.400 --> 00:32:38.000
 lots of things to maintain.

00:32:38.000 --> 00:32:40.720
 In general, we found particularly with deep learning,

00:32:40.720 --> 00:32:42.840
 less code is better.

00:32:42.840 --> 00:32:48.120
 Particularly with Fast.AI, the code you don't write
