00:49:28.280 --> 00:49:32.640
 to grab batches of randomly split out,

00:49:32.640 --> 00:49:35.360
 training images to train the model with,

00:49:35.360 --> 00:49:39.680
 and validation images to test the model with.

00:49:39.680 --> 00:49:42.680
 So now we need a model.

00:49:42.680 --> 00:49:46.400
 The critical concept here in Fast.AI is called a learner.
