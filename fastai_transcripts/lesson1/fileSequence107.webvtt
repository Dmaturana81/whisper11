00:26:44.440 --> 00:26:45.480
 automatically.

00:26:45.480 --> 00:26:48.640
 But this is the key difference of why we can now

00:26:48.640 --> 00:26:51.360
 do things that previously we just didn't even

00:26:51.360 --> 00:26:52.920
 conceive of as possible.

00:26:52.920 --> 00:26:57.680
 Because now we don't have to hand code the features we look for.

00:26:57.680 --> 00:27:01.680
 They can all be learned.
