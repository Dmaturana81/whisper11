01:16:27.800 --> 01:16:31.080
 So they're not the kinds of normal functions you

01:16:31.080 --> 01:16:35.720
 do in year eight math, but they are computable functions.

01:16:35.720 --> 01:16:41.560
 And so therefore, if we can just create this step,

01:16:41.560 --> 01:16:45.520
 then and use the neural network as a model,
