00:41:27.880 --> 00:41:30.520
 because it's actually much faster.

00:41:30.520 --> 00:41:34.520
 Because GPU is so quick, for big images,

00:41:34.520 --> 00:41:37.520
 most of the time can be taken up just opening it

00:41:37.520 --> 00:41:40.640
 the neural net itself often takes less time.

00:41:40.640 --> 00:41:42.440
 So that's another good reason to make them smaller.
