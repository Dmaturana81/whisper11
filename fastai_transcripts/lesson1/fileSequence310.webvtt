01:17:27.160 --> 01:17:30.880
 And that's why we can do what I described earlier.

01:17:30.880 --> 01:17:33.480
 Once we've got that learned dot predict for our bird

01:17:33.480 --> 01:17:38.000
 recognizer, we can insert it into any piece of computer code.

01:17:38.000 --> 01:17:42.520
 Once we've got a trained model as just another piece of code,

01:17:42.520 --> 01:17:47.320
 we can call with some inputs and get some outputs.
