 What am I actually going to be looking at to train from?

00:45:00.800 --> 00:45:02.200
 This is a function.

00:45:02.200 --> 00:45:03.800
 In fact, you might have noticed, if you

00:45:03.800 --> 00:45:08.200
 were looking carefully, that we use this function here.

00:45:08.200 --> 00:45:12.960
 It's a function which returns a list of all of the image

00:45:12.960 --> 00:45:16.600
 files in a path based on extension.
