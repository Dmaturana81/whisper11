00:16:26.160 --> 00:16:30.120
 is from the way we teach sports, for example,

00:16:30.120 --> 00:16:32.720
 where we show you a whole game of sports,

00:16:32.720 --> 00:16:34.480
 we show you how much fun it is,

00:16:34.480 --> 00:16:36.160
 you go and start playing sports,

00:16:36.160 --> 00:16:39.120
 simple versions of them, you're not very good, right?

00:16:39.120 --> 00:16:41.800
 And then you gradually put more and more pieces together.

00:16:41.800 --> 00:16:44.320
 So that's how we do deep learning.

00:16:44.320 --> 00:16:47.680
 You will go into as much depth
