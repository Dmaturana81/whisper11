01:17:58.920 --> 01:18:01.560
 that you're just going to have a line of code that says

01:18:01.560 --> 01:18:02.480
 learned dot predict.

01:18:02.480 --> 01:18:04.160
 And then you just fit it in with all the rest

01:18:04.160 --> 01:18:05.640
 of your code in the usual way.

01:18:05.640 --> 01:18:08.600
 And this is why, because a trained model is just

01:18:08.600 --> 01:18:20.280
 another thing that maps inputs to results.
