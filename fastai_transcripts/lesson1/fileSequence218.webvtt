00:54:28.880 --> 00:54:37.920
 So that's how we can create a computer vision model.

00:54:37.920 --> 00:54:39.880
 What about other kinds of models?

00:54:39.880 --> 00:54:43.160
 There's a lot more in the world than just computer vision.

00:54:43.160 --> 00:54:45.160
 A lot more than just image recognition.
