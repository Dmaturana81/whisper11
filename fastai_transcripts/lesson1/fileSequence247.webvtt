 The interesting thing about collaborative filtering

01:01:46.800 --> 01:01:48.400
 is that when we say similar users,

01:01:48.400 --> 01:01:52.640
 we're not referring to similar demographically,

01:01:52.640 --> 01:01:58.080
 but similar in the sense of people who liked the same kinds

01:01:58.080 --> 01:02:00.400
 of products.
