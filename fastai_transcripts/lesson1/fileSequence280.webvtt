01:09:58.480 --> 01:10:02.320
 If it's something that takes a lot of logical thought

01:10:02.320 --> 01:10:05.080
 processes over an extended period of time,

01:10:05.080 --> 01:10:09.960
 particularly if it's not based on much data, maybe not.

01:10:09.960 --> 01:10:13.240
 Like who's going to win the next election or something

01:10:13.240 --> 01:10:14.320
 like that?

01:10:14.320 --> 01:10:16.560
 That'd be kind of broadly how I would try to decide
