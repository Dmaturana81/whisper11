00:44:44.640 --> 00:44:49.360
 So that means it's one of a number of possibilities.

00:44:49.360 --> 00:44:52.960
 So that's enough for Fast.DI to know what kind of model

00:44:52.960 --> 00:44:55.640
 to build for you.

00:44:55.640 --> 00:44:57.160
 So what are the items in this model?

00:44:57.160 --> 00:45:00.800
 What am I actually going to be looking at to train from?
