00:45:57.760 --> 00:46:01.800
 is how do we know the correct label of a photo?

00:46:01.800 --> 00:46:05.680
 How do we know if it's a bird photo or a forest photo?

00:46:05.680 --> 00:46:08.800
 And this is another function.

00:46:08.800 --> 00:46:13.640
 And this function simply returns the parent folder

00:46:13.640 --> 00:46:16.360
 of a path.
