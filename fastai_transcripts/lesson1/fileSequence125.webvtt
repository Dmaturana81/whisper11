 It's going to be increasingly difficult to use TensorFlow.

00:31:18.640 --> 00:31:21.440
 We've been using PyTorch since before it came out,

00:31:21.440 --> 00:31:23.640
 before the initial release, because we knew just

00:31:23.640 --> 00:31:27.400
 from technical fundamentals, it was far better.

00:31:27.400 --> 00:31:30.680
 So this course has been using PyTorch for a long time.
