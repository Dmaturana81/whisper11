01:20:27.240 --> 01:20:30.920
 So this person classified different types of Trinidad

01:20:30.920 --> 01:20:32.040
 and Tobago people.

01:20:32.040 --> 01:20:34.760
 So people do stuff based on where they live

01:20:34.760 --> 01:20:36.000
 and what their interests are.

01:20:36.000 --> 01:20:37.760
 I don't know if this person is particularly interested

01:20:37.760 --> 01:20:39.480
 in zucchini and cucumber, but they

01:20:39.480 --> 01:20:41.480
 meet as zucchini and cucumber classifier.

01:20:41.480 --> 01:20:43.840
 I thought this was a really interesting one's

01:20:43.840 --> 01:20:47.040
 classifying satellite imagery into what city it's probably
