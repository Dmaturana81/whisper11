01:03:41.400 --> 01:03:45.080
 So that's why I say 0.5 to 5.5.

01:03:45.080 --> 01:03:46.320
 And then fine tune.

01:03:46.320 --> 01:03:48.480
 Now again, we don't really need to fine tune here

01:03:48.480 --> 01:03:50.680
 because there's not really such a thing as a pre trained

01:03:50.680 --> 01:03:51.800
 collaborative filtering model.

01:03:51.800 --> 01:03:54.320
 We could just say fit or fit one cycle,

01:03:54.320 --> 01:03:57.600
 but actually fine tune works fine as well.

01:03:57.600 --> 01:04:02.400
 So after we train it for a while, this here
