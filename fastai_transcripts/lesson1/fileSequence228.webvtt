00:56:54.160 --> 00:57:02.600
 Data blocks are a intermediate level, very flexible approach

00:57:02.600 --> 00:57:06.520
 that you can take to handling almost any kind of data.

00:57:06.520 --> 00:57:09.120
 But for the kinds of data that occur a lot,

00:57:09.120 --> 00:57:14.000
 you can use these special data loaders classes, which

00:57:14.000 --> 00:57:15.720
 lets you use even less code.
