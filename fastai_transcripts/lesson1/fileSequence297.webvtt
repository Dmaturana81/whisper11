01:14:11.960 --> 01:14:15.080
 And then let's decide how good they are.

01:14:15.080 --> 01:14:18.080
 So if, for example, we're trying to decide,

01:14:18.080 --> 01:14:20.080
 is this a picture of a bird?

01:14:20.080 --> 01:14:22.800
 And the model said, which initially is random,

01:14:22.800 --> 01:14:24.160
 says this isn't a bird.

01:14:24.160 --> 01:14:25.680
 And actually, it is a bird.

01:14:25.680 --> 01:14:27.720
 We would say, oh, you're wrong.

01:14:27.720 --> 01:14:29.880
 So we then calculate the loss.

01:14:29.880 --> 01:14:33.200
 So the loss is a number that says how good were the results.
