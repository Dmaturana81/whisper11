00:31:43.520 --> 00:31:47.480
 I actually copied this code from the PyTorch repository.

00:31:47.480 --> 00:31:51.240
 So as you can see, there's a lot of it.

00:31:51.240 --> 00:31:55.440
 This gray bit here is the code required

00:31:55.440 --> 00:31:57.960
 to do the same thing with Fast.AI.

00:31:57.960 --> 00:32:02.360
 Fast.AI is a library we built on top of PyTorch.
