01:12:58.160 --> 01:13:01.920
 multiplies them together by the weights, by one set of weights,

01:13:01.920 --> 01:13:03.240
 and adds them up.

01:13:03.240 --> 01:13:05.240
 And then it does that again for a second set of weights

01:13:05.240 --> 01:13:05.920
 and adds them up.

01:13:05.920 --> 01:13:09.840
 It does it again for a third set of weights and adds them up,

01:13:09.840 --> 01:13:09.800
 and so forth.

01:13:09.800 --> 01:13:11.840
 It then takes all the negative numbers

01:13:11.840 --> 01:13:14.840
 and replaces them with zeros.

01:13:14.840 --> 01:13:18.160
 And then it takes those as inputs to a next layer.
