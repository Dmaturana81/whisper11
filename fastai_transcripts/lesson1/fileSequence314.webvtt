01:18:28.480 --> 01:18:35.480
 and Python, this is going to be pretty easy for you.

01:18:35.480 --> 01:18:37.400
 You're just going to be using some stuff that you're already

01:18:37.400 --> 01:18:39.880
 familiar with in some slightly new libraries.

01:18:39.880 --> 01:18:44.760
 For those of you who are not familiar with Python,

01:18:44.760 --> 01:18:46.520
 you're biting into a big thing here.
