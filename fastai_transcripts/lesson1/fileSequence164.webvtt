00:40:57.840 --> 00:41:02.000
 And so you can see, fast di has a download images

00:41:02.000 --> 00:41:04.640
 where you just provide a list of URLs.

00:41:04.640 --> 00:41:05.960
 So that's how easy it is.

00:41:05.960 --> 00:41:07.880
 And it does that in parallel.

00:41:07.880 --> 00:41:12.920
 So it does that surprisingly quickly.

00:41:12.920 --> 00:41:17.520
 One other fast thing I think I'm using here is resize images.
