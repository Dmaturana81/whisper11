01:03:57.600 --> 01:04:02.400
 So after we train it for a while, this here

01:04:02.400 --> 01:04:04.520
 is the mean squared error.

01:04:04.520 --> 01:04:08.240
 So it's basically about on average how far off are we

01:04:08.240 --> 01:04:09.840
 for the validation set.

01:04:09.840 --> 01:04:13.040
 And you can see as we train, and it's literally so fast,

01:04:13.040 --> 01:04:16.000
 it's less than a second, each epoch.
