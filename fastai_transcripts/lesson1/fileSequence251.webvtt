01:02:41.520 --> 01:02:45.720
 It's going to have generally speaking a user ID, some kind

01:02:45.720 --> 01:02:46.720
 of product ID.

01:02:46.720 --> 01:02:51.680
 In this case, a movie and a rating.

01:02:51.680 --> 01:02:57.320
 So in this case, this user gave this movie a rating of 3.5

01:02:57.320 --> 01:02:58.640
 out of 5.

01:02:58.640 --> 01:03:00.400
 And so again, you can see ShowBatch.
