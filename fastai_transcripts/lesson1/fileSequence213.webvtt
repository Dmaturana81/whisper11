00:53:13.680 --> 00:53:21.560
 After a few seconds, it's 100% accurate.

00:53:21.560 --> 00:53:23.880
 So we now have a learner.

00:53:23.880 --> 00:53:27.720
 And this learner has started with a pre trained model.

00:53:27.720 --> 00:53:29.640
 It's been fine tuned for the purpose

00:53:29.640 --> 00:53:35.600
 of recognizing bird pictures from forest pictures.
