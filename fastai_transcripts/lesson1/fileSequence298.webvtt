01:14:29.880 --> 01:14:33.200
 So the loss is a number that says how good were the results.

01:14:35.200 --> 01:14:36.720
 So that's all pretty straightforward.

01:14:36.720 --> 01:14:38.880
 You know, we could, for example, say, oh, what's the accuracy?

01:14:38.880 --> 01:14:40.800
 We could look at 100 photos and say,

01:14:40.800 --> 01:14:43.720
 which percentage of them did it get right?

01:14:43.720 --> 01:14:45.720
 No worries.
