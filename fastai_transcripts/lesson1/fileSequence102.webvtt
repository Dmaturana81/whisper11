00:25:27.520 --> 00:25:30.000
 Now, here are some examples of bits of pictures

00:25:30.000 --> 00:25:32.680
 that the circle finder found.

00:25:32.680 --> 00:25:35.840
 And so remember, with a neural net, which

00:25:35.840 --> 00:25:38.440
 is the basic function used in deep learning,

00:25:38.440 --> 00:25:41.080
 we don't have to hand code any of these

00:25:41.080 --> 00:25:43.680
 or come up with any of these ideas.

00:25:43.680 --> 00:25:47.520
 You just start with actually a random neural network
