00:04:57.120 --> 00:05:00.200
 So we've got some birds, forest, bird, bird, forest.

00:05:00.200 --> 00:05:02.520
 OK, so one of the nice things about doing computer vision

00:05:02.520 --> 00:05:04.600
 models is it's really easy to check your data,

00:05:04.600 --> 00:05:06.320
 because you can just look at it, which

00:05:06.320 --> 00:05:10.200
 is not the case for a lot of kinds of models.

00:05:10.200 --> 00:05:11.360
 OK.

00:05:11.360 --> 00:05:13.960
 So we've now downloaded 200 pictures of birds,

00:05:13.960 --> 00:05:17.680
 200 pictures of forests.
