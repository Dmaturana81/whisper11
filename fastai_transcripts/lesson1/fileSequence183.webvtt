00:45:43.560 --> 00:45:45.320
 how to set aside some data.

00:45:45.320 --> 00:45:50.920
 And in this case, we say randomly set aside 20% of the data.

00:45:53.400 --> 00:45:54.880
 OK.

00:45:54.880 --> 00:45:57.760
 Next question, then you have to tell Fast.DI,

00:45:57.760 --> 00:46:01.800
 is how do we know the correct label of a photo?
