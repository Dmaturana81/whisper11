00:57:42.920 --> 00:57:48.120
 So the labels for segmentation, sorry, the codes.

00:57:48.120 --> 00:57:50.520
 So what does each code mean?

00:57:50.520 --> 00:57:52.720
 It's going to be this text file.

00:57:52.720 --> 00:57:56.080
 But you can see the basic information we're providing

00:57:56.080 --> 00:57:58.600
 is very, very similar, regardless of whether we're

00:57:58.600 --> 00:58:02.320
 doing segmentation or object recognition.
