01:03:14.480 --> 01:03:16.680
 This time it's a collaborative filtering learner.

01:03:16.680 --> 01:03:20.920
 And you pass in your data.

01:03:20.920 --> 01:03:23.480
 In this case, we give it one extra piece of information,

01:03:23.480 --> 01:03:26.360
 which is because this is not predicting a category,

01:03:26.360 --> 01:03:28.880
 but it's predicting a real number,

01:03:28.880 --> 01:03:31.680
 we tell it what's the possible range.
