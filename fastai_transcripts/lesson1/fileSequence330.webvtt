01:22:29.480 --> 01:22:31.200
 then start with something simple.

01:22:31.200 --> 01:22:33.120
 But I think you'll find people very encouraging.

01:22:33.120 --> 01:22:34.960
 And if you've done this a few times before,

01:22:34.960 --> 01:22:37.960
 then try to push yourself a little bit further.

01:22:37.960 --> 01:22:40.120
 And don't forget to look at the quiz questions

01:22:40.120 --> 01:22:42.760
 at the end of the book and see if you can answer them

01:22:42.760 --> 01:22:43.440
 all correctly.
