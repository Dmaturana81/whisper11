01:11:27.120 --> 01:11:30.880
 largely as it was described by Arthur Samuel in the late 50s

01:11:30.880 --> 01:11:33.480
 when it was invented.

01:11:33.480 --> 01:11:39.560
 And I'm going to kind of do it with these graphs, which,

01:11:39.560 --> 01:11:42.120
 by the way, you might find fun.

01:11:42.120 --> 01:11:54.000
 These graphs themselves created with Jupyter Notebooks.
