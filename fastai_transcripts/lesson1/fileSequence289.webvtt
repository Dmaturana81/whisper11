 well, you still have inputs, and you still have results.

01:12:15.000 --> 01:12:17.200
 And then you code a program in the middle,

01:12:17.200 --> 01:12:20.240
 which is a bunch of conditionals and loops and setting

01:12:20.240 --> 01:12:22.200
 variables and blah, blah, blah.

01:12:22.200 --> 01:12:24.400
 OK.

01:12:24.400 --> 01:12:27.640
 A machine learning model doesn't look that different.
