01:12:30.560 --> 01:12:35.920
 But the program has been replaced with something

01:12:35.920 --> 01:12:37.600
 called a model.

01:12:37.600 --> 01:12:39.640
 And we don't just have inputs now.

01:12:39.640 --> 01:12:43.640
 We now also have weights, which are also called parameters.

01:12:43.640 --> 01:12:45.040
 And the key thing is this.
