00:57:14.000 --> 00:57:15.720
 lets you use even less code.

00:57:15.720 --> 00:57:20.120
 So this case to create data loaders for segmentation,

00:57:20.120 --> 00:57:21.720
 you can just say, OK, I'm going to pass you

00:57:21.720 --> 00:57:24.160
 in a function for labeling.

00:57:24.160 --> 00:57:27.440
 And you can see here, it's got pretty similar things

00:57:27.440 --> 00:57:31.320
 that we pass in to what we passed in for data blocks before.
