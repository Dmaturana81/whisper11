00:58:27.800 --> 00:58:30.440
 So taking things like spreadsheets and database tables

00:58:30.440 --> 00:58:31.800
 and trying to predict columns of those.

00:58:37.640 --> 00:58:41.080
 So in tabular analysis, it really

00:58:41.080 --> 00:58:45.040
 looks very similar to what we've seen already.
