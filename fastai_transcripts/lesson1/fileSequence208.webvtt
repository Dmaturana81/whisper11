 Well, the reason we can do this so fast

00:52:01.040 --> 00:52:06.320
 is because somebody else has already trained this model

00:52:06.320 --> 00:52:10.120
 to recognize over 1 million images of over 1,000 different

00:52:10.120 --> 00:52:14.160
 types, something called the ImageNet Dataset.

00:52:14.160 --> 00:52:18.760
 And they then made those weights available,
