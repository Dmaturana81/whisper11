X-TIMESTAMP-MAP=MPEGTS:900000,LOCAL:00:00:00.000

00:55:43.040 --> 00:55:49.440
 And then on the right is what our model is guessing.

00:55:49.440 --> 00:55:52.720
 And as you can see, it's getting a lot of the pixels

00:55:52.720 --> 00:55:57.800
 correct, and some of them is getting wrong.

00:55:57.800 --> 00:55:59.640
 It's actually amazing how many is getting correct,

00:55:59.640 --> 00:56:13.720
 because this particular model I trained in about 20 seconds
