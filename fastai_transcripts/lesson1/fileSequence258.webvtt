 you can always call show results and get something sensible.

01:04:30.800 --> 01:04:31.880
 So in this case, it's going to show

01:04:31.880 --> 01:04:34.600
 a few examples of users and movies.

01:04:34.600 --> 01:04:37.680
 Here's the actual rating that user gave that movie.

01:04:37.680 --> 01:04:42.160
 And here's the rating that the model predicted.

01:04:42.160 --> 01:04:44.360
 OK, so apparently a lot of people on the forum

01:04:44.360 --> 01:04:51.120
 are asking how I'm turning this notebook into a presentation.
