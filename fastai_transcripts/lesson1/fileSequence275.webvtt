01:08:41.680 --> 01:08:45.160
 I work in domain X, and I thought I might try deep learning

01:08:45.160 --> 01:08:47.080
 out to see if it can help.

01:08:47.080 --> 01:08:49.840
 And I say them a few months later, and I say, how did it go?

01:08:49.840 --> 01:08:51.840
 They nearly always say, wow, we just broke the state

01:08:51.840 --> 01:08:54.440
 of the art results in our field.

01:08:54.440 --> 01:08:56.680
 So when I say these are things that it's currently

01:08:56.680 --> 01:08:58.960
 state of the art for, these are kind of the ones

01:08:58.960 --> 01:09:00.320
 that people have tried so far.
