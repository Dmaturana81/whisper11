00:31:27.400 --> 00:31:30.680
 So this course has been using PyTorch for a long time.

00:31:30.680 --> 00:31:33.280
 I will say, however, that PyTorch requires

00:31:33.280 --> 00:31:36.920
 a lot of hairy code for relatively simple things.

00:31:36.920 --> 00:31:40.440
 This is the code required to implement a particular optimizer,

00:31:40.440 --> 00:31:43.520
 called Adam W, in plain PyTorch.

00:31:43.520 --> 00:31:47.480
 I actually copied this code from the PyTorch repository.
