01:00:44.920 --> 01:00:47.200
 that already does something like what you want,

01:00:47.200 --> 01:00:50.960
 because every table of data is very different.

01:00:50.960 --> 01:00:53.960
 Whereas pictures often have a similar theme.

01:00:53.960 --> 01:00:55.040
 You know, they're all pictures.

01:00:55.040 --> 01:00:58.880
 They all have the same kind of general idea of what pictures are.

01:00:58.880 --> 01:01:02.240
 So that's why it generally doesn't make too much sense
