00:46:58.720 --> 00:47:01.480
 or you can squish it.

00:47:01.480 --> 00:47:05.760
 And so we're saying squish it.

00:47:05.760 --> 00:47:06.760
 So that's the data block.

00:47:06.760 --> 00:47:08.240
 That's all that you need.

00:47:08.240 --> 00:47:11.800
 And from there, we create an important class

00:47:11.800 --> 00:47:13.080
 called data loaders.

00:47:13.080 --> 00:47:17.560
 Data loaders are the things that actually PyTorch iterates
