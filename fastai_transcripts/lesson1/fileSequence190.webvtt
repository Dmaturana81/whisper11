00:47:28.040 --> 00:47:30.160
 And that means it needs thousands of things to do

00:47:30.160 --> 00:47:31.880
 at the same time.

00:47:31.880 --> 00:47:35.720
 So a data loader will feed the training algorithm

00:47:35.720 --> 00:47:40.800
 with a bunch of your images at once.

00:47:40.800 --> 00:47:42.040
 In fact, we don't call it a bunch.

00:47:42.040 --> 00:47:46.680
 We call it a batch or a mini batch.
