01:20:58.400 --> 01:21:02.200
 This one, very practically important,

01:21:02.200 --> 01:21:04.120
 recognizing the state of buildings.

01:21:04.120 --> 01:21:05.720
 We've had quite a few students actually

01:21:05.720 --> 01:21:08.560
 move into disaster resilience based on satellite imagery

01:21:08.560 --> 01:21:11.840
 using exactly this kind of work.

01:21:11.840 --> 01:21:14.440
 We've already actually seen this example, Ethan

01:21:14.440 --> 01:21:16.560
 Sooten, the sound classifier.
