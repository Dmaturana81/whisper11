01:05:04.560 --> 01:05:08.640
 And in your notebook, it gives you an extra little thing

01:05:08.640 --> 01:05:10.640
 on the side where you say which things are slides

01:05:10.640 --> 01:05:12.360
 or which things are fragments.

01:05:12.360 --> 01:05:15.080
 And a fragment just being, so this is a slide that's a fragment.
