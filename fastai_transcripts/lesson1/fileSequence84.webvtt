X-TIMESTAMP-MAP=MPEGTS:900000,LOCAL:00:00:00.000

00:20:58.440 --> 00:21:00.400
 So the first time it appeared was not actually

00:21:00.400 --> 00:21:05.840
 in the journal.

00:21:05.840 --> 00:21:08.960
 It was actually in lesson four of the course.

00:21:08.960 --> 00:21:15.040
 I think the 2016 course, if I remember correctly.
