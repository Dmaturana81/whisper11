 in about two minutes.

00:01:15.440 --> 00:01:17.160

 And so I'm going to run through this really quickly.

00:01:24.040 --> 00:01:25.720
 You're not expected to run through it with me,

00:01:25.720 --> 00:01:27.920
 because we're going to come back to it.

00:01:27.920 --> 00:01:31.280
 But let's go ahead and run that cell.
