00:25:58.560 --> 00:26:03.480
 So you can then combine these features.

00:26:03.480 --> 00:26:05.560
 And when you combine these features,

00:26:05.560 --> 00:26:07.440
 it creates a feature detector, for example,

00:26:07.440 --> 00:26:11.560
 that finds kind of repeating geometric shapes.

00:26:11.560 --> 00:26:14.160
 And it creates a feature detector, for example,

00:26:14.160 --> 00:26:17.880
 that finds kind of really little things, which it looks like,
