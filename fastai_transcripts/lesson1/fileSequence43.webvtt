00:10:43.880 --> 00:10:47.760
 means for a language model to be thinking.

00:10:47.760 --> 00:10:49.120
 One of the ones I found pretty amazing

00:10:49.120 --> 00:10:51.560
 was that it can explain a joke.

00:10:51.560 --> 00:10:52.440
 I'll let you read this.

00:10:52.440 --> 00:11:12.280
 So this is actually a joke that probably needs explanations.
