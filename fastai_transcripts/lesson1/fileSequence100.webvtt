00:24:58.960 --> 00:25:03.440
 And then down here are examples of some bits of photos,

00:25:03.440 --> 00:25:07.920
 which closely matched, for example, this feature detector.

00:25:07.920 --> 00:25:13.920
 And deep learning is deep because we can then take these

00:25:13.920 --> 00:25:18.880
 features and combine them to create more advanced features.
