00:36:27.760 --> 00:36:31.040
 certainly in JavaScript would be the top two,

00:36:31.040 --> 00:36:32.640
 directly at your disposal.

00:36:32.640 --> 00:36:35.200
 So Python does know how to do one plus one.

00:36:35.200 --> 00:36:38.080
 And so you can see here it spits out the answer.

00:36:38.080 --> 00:36:39.160
 I hate clicking.

00:36:39.160 --> 00:36:40.560
 I always use keyboard shortcuts.

00:36:40.560 --> 00:36:42.160
 So instead of clicking this little arrow,

00:36:42.160 --> 00:36:46.680
 you just press shift enter to do the same thing.
