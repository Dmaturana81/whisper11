00:58:12.880 --> 00:58:15.040
 So that is it.

00:58:15.040 --> 00:58:19.320
 And that's how we create a segmentation model.

00:58:19.320 --> 00:58:21.720
 What about stepping away from computer vision?

00:58:21.720 --> 00:58:26.520
 So perhaps the most widely used kind of model used in industry

00:58:26.520 --> 00:58:27.800
 is tabular analysis.

00:58:27.800 --> 00:58:30.440
 So taking things like spreadsheets and database tables
