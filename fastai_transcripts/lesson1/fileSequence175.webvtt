X-TIMESTAMP-MAP=MPEGTS:900000,LOCAL:00:00:00.000

00:43:44.640 --> 00:43:45.880
 works very well.

00:43:45.880 --> 00:43:49.120
 If you're a lot of people in Python or less familiar with that,

00:43:49.120 --> 00:43:51.760
 it maybe comes more from other things.

00:43:51.760 --> 00:43:54.080
 So that's why you'll see me using stuff like math

00:43:54.080 --> 00:43:56.400
 and stuff quite a lot.

00:43:56.400 --> 00:43:59.760
 All right, so a data block is the key thing

00:43:59.760 --> 00:44:01.880
 you need to know about if you're going to know
