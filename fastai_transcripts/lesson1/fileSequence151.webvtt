00:37:48.080 --> 00:37:50.280
 One thing to point out is that sometimes you'll

00:37:50.280 --> 00:37:53.400
 see me use cells with an exclamation mark at the start.

00:37:53.400 --> 00:37:54.840
 That's not Python.

00:37:54.840 --> 00:37:57.800
 That's a bash shell command.

00:37:57.800 --> 00:37:59.720
 So that's what the exclamation mark means.
