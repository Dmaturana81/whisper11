00:51:12.920 --> 00:51:19.320
 Having said that, the model family called ResNet

00:51:19.320 --> 00:51:21.560
 are probably going to be fine for nearly all the things

00:51:21.560 --> 00:51:22.840
 you want to do.

00:51:22.840 --> 00:51:25.120

00:51:25.120 --> 00:51:30.000
 So you can type in any string here
