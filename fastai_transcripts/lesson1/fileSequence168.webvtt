 Because the main thing you're going to be trying to figure out

00:42:04.440 --> 00:42:08.560
 is how do I get this data into my model?

00:42:08.560 --> 00:42:09.840
 Now that might surprise you.

00:42:09.840 --> 00:42:12.120
 You might be thinking we should be spending all of our time

00:42:12.120 --> 00:42:14.600
 talking about neural network architectures

00:42:14.600 --> 00:42:18.720
 and matrix modification and gradients and stuff like that.
