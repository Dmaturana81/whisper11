 you're biting into a big thing here.

01:18:46.520 --> 01:18:49.040
 There's obviously a lot you're going to have to learn.

01:18:49.040 --> 01:18:53.880
 And to be clear, I'm not going to be teaching Python

01:18:53.880 --> 01:18:55.000
 in this course.

01:18:55.000 --> 01:18:57.880
 But we do have links to great Python resources

01:18:57.880 --> 01:18:59.400
 in the forum.

01:18:59.400 --> 01:19:03.640
 So check out that thread.
