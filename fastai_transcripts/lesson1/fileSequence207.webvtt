 So it doesn't really have anything ready to go.

00:51:49.640 --> 00:51:51.200
 So when I ran this, the first thing it did

00:51:51.200 --> 00:51:56.360
 was it said downloading ResNet18.pth.

00:51:56.360 --> 00:51:57.560
 What's that?

00:51:57.560 --> 00:52:01.040
 Well, the reason we can do this so fast
