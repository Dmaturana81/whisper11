01:13:14.840 --> 01:13:18.160
 And then it takes those as inputs to a next layer.

01:13:18.160 --> 01:13:19.320
 It does the same thing.

01:13:19.320 --> 01:13:21.960
 It multiplies them a bunch of times and adds them up.

01:13:21.960 --> 01:13:23.960
 And it does that a few times.

01:13:23.960 --> 01:13:26.960
 And that's called a neural network.

01:13:26.960 --> 01:13:31.560
 Now, the model, therefore, is not
