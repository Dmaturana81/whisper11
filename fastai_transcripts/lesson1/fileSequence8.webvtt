00:01:57.680 --> 00:02:00.960
 that can download pictures of birds.

00:02:00.960 --> 00:02:03.320
 Now, we're going to need to build a system that

00:02:03.320 --> 00:02:06.720
 can recognize things that are birds versus things

00:02:06.720 --> 00:02:08.320
 that aren't birds from photos.

00:02:08.320 --> 00:02:13.520
 Now, of course, computers need numbers to work with.

00:02:13.520 --> 00:02:17.400
 But luckily, images are made of numbers.
