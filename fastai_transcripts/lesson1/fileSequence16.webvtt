00:03:57.120 --> 00:04:00.560
 to be no bigger than 400 pixels on a side,

00:04:00.560 --> 00:04:02.720
 just because we don't need particularly big ones.

00:04:02.720 --> 00:04:04.520
 It takes a surprisingly large amount of time

00:04:04.520 --> 00:04:06.760
 to just recompute it open an image.

00:04:06.760 --> 00:04:11.040
 OK, so we've now got 200 of each.

00:04:11.040 --> 00:04:14.320
 I find when I download images, I often get a few broken ones.

00:04:14.320 --> 00:04:16.560
 And if you try and train a model with broken images,
