01:12:43.640 --> 01:12:45.040
 And the key thing is this.

01:12:45.040 --> 01:12:49.400
 The model is not any more a bunch of conditionals

01:12:49.400 --> 01:12:51.000
 and loops and things.

01:12:51.000 --> 01:12:52.760
 It's a mathematical function.

01:12:52.760 --> 01:12:54.560
 In the case of a neural network, it's

01:12:54.560 --> 01:12:58.160
 a mathematical function that takes the inputs,

01:12:58.160 --> 01:13:01.920
 multiplies them together by the weights, by one set of weights,
