00:57:58.600 --> 00:58:02.320
 doing segmentation or object recognition.

00:58:02.320 --> 00:58:04.120
 And then the next steps are pretty much the same.

00:58:04.120 --> 00:58:05.640
 We create a learner.

00:58:05.640 --> 00:58:07.960
 The segmentation, we create something called a unit learner,

00:58:07.960 --> 00:58:09.680
 which we'll learn about later.

00:58:09.680 --> 00:58:12.880
 And then again, we call fine tune.

00:58:12.880 --> 00:58:15.040
 So that is it.
