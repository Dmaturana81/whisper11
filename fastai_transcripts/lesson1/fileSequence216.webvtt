00:53:57.600 --> 00:54:01.240
 had some reason that he needs the app to check

00:54:01.240 --> 00:54:02.520
 whether they're in a national park

00:54:02.520 --> 00:54:03.880
 and whether it's a photo of a bird.

00:54:03.880 --> 00:54:06.240
 So at the bit where they need to know if it's a photo of a bird,

00:54:06.240 --> 00:54:11.960
 it would just call this one line of code, learn dot predict.

00:54:11.960 --> 00:54:16.240
 And so that's going to return whether it's a bird or not
