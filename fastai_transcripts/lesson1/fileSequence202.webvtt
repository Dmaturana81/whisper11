00:50:29.960 --> 00:50:33.360
 is that we integrate a wonderful library

00:50:33.360 --> 00:50:36.960
 by Ross Weitman called Tim, the PyTorch image models, which

00:50:36.960 --> 00:50:39.120
 is the largest collection of computer vision models

00:50:39.120 --> 00:50:40.400
 in the world.

00:50:40.400 --> 00:50:44.040
 And at this point, Fast.AI is the first and only framework

00:50:44.040 --> 00:50:45.040
 to integrate this.
