01:13:26.960 --> 01:13:31.560
 Now, the model, therefore, is not

01:13:31.560 --> 01:13:32.680
 going to do anything useful.

01:13:32.680 --> 01:13:36.720
 And this leads weights to very carefully, it shows it.

01:13:36.720 --> 01:13:38.720
 And so the way it works is that we actually

01:13:38.720 --> 01:13:42.480
 start out with these weights as being random.

01:13:42.480 --> 01:13:47.600
 So initially, this thing doesn't do anything useful at all.
