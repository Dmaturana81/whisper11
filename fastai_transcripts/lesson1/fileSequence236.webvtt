00:58:59.240 --> 00:59:02.360
 that you might want to use, all the ones that are in the book,

00:59:02.360 --> 00:59:04.360
 or lots of data sets that are kind of widely used

00:59:04.360 --> 00:59:06.480
 in learning and research.

00:59:06.480 --> 00:59:08.880
 So that makes life nice and easy for you.

00:59:08.880 --> 00:59:10.360
 So again, we've got to create data loaders.

00:59:10.360 --> 00:59:12.480
 But this time is tabular data loaders.

00:59:12.480 --> 00:59:14.960
 But we provide pretty similar kind of information

00:59:14.960 --> 00:59:16.840
 to what we have before.
