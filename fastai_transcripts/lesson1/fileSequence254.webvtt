01:03:28.880 --> 01:03:31.680
 we tell it what's the possible range.

01:03:31.680 --> 01:03:34.400
 The actual range is 1 to 5.

01:03:34.400 --> 01:03:36.120
 But for reasons you'll learn about later,

01:03:36.120 --> 01:03:38.920
 it's a good idea to actually go from a little bit lower

01:03:38.920 --> 01:03:41.400
 than the possible minimum to a little bit higher.

01:03:41.400 --> 01:03:45.080
 So that's why I say 0.5 to 5.5.
