00:17:58.320 --> 00:18:01.040
 because I don't like turning my own horn,

00:18:01.040 --> 00:18:03.240
 but I know it's important.

00:18:03.240 --> 00:18:04.720
 So the first thing I mentioned about me

00:18:04.720 --> 00:18:06.840
 is that me and my friend, Stolve,

00:18:06.840 --> 00:18:09.800
 wrote this extremely popular book, Deep Learning for Coders,

00:18:09.800 --> 00:18:13.920
 and that book is what this course is quite heavily based on.

00:18:13.920 --> 00:18:16.360
 We're not going to be using any material from the book
