00:24:43.800 --> 00:24:47.240
 And this was nine of the sets of weights they found.

00:24:47.240 --> 00:24:48.960
 And this set of weights, for example,

00:24:48.960 --> 00:24:50.760
 finds diagonal edges.

00:24:50.760 --> 00:24:53.640
 This set of weights finds yellow to blue gradients.

00:24:53.640 --> 00:24:57.880
 And this set of weights finds red to green gradients.

00:24:57.880 --> 00:24:58.960
 And so forth.

00:24:58.960 --> 00:25:03.440
 And then down here are examples of some bits of photos,
