00:56:13.720 --> 00:56:16.440
 using a tiny, tiny, tiny amount of data.

00:56:16.440 --> 00:56:20.240
 So again, you would think this would be a particularly

00:56:20.240 --> 00:56:24.880
 challenging problem to solve.

00:56:24.880 --> 00:56:26.960
 But it took about 20 seconds of training

00:56:26.960 --> 00:56:30.120
 to solve it not amazingly well, but pretty well.
