00:03:29.760 --> 00:03:32.680
 And I needed bird and nonbird, but you can't really

00:03:32.680 --> 00:03:35.280
 search Google images or dap, dap, dap,

00:03:35.280 --> 00:03:37.640
 go images for not a bird.

00:03:37.640 --> 00:03:39.240
 This doesn't work that way.

00:03:39.240 --> 00:03:40.640
 So I just decided to use forest.

00:03:40.640 --> 00:03:43.680
 I thought, OK, pictures of forest versus pictures of bird

00:03:43.680 --> 00:03:45.960
 sounds like a good starting point.
