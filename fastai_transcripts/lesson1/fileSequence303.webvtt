01:15:43.560 --> 01:15:45.840
 is, which is basically multiplying things together

01:15:45.840 --> 01:15:49.360
 and adding them up and replacing the negatives with zeros.

01:15:49.360 --> 01:15:51.320
 And you do that a few times.

01:15:51.320 --> 01:15:55.880
 That is, provably, an infinitely flexible function.

01:15:55.880 --> 01:15:59.960
 So it actually turns out that that incredibly simple sequence

01:15:59.960 --> 01:16:03.600
 of steps, if you're repeated a few times,
