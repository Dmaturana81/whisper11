X-TIMESTAMP-MAP=MPEGTS:900000,LOCAL:00:00:00.000

00:51:25.120 --> 00:51:30.000
 So you can type in any string here

00:51:30.000 --> 00:51:32.440
 to use any one of those other models.

00:51:35.920 --> 00:51:40.080
 OK, so if we run that, let's see what happens.

00:51:40.080 --> 00:51:41.160
 OK, so this is interesting.

00:51:41.160 --> 00:51:44.160
 So when I ran this, so remember on Kaggle,

00:51:44.160 --> 00:51:47.560
 it's creating a new virtual computer for us.
