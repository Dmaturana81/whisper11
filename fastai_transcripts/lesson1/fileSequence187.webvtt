 that are going to run on every item, on every image in this case.

00:46:46.600 --> 00:46:50.960
 And we're saying, OK, we want you to resize each of them

00:46:50.960 --> 00:46:54.600
 to being 192 by 192 pixels.

00:46:54.600 --> 00:46:55.920
 There's two ways you can resize.

00:46:55.920 --> 00:46:58.720
 You can either crop out a piece in the middle,

00:46:58.720 --> 00:47:01.480
 or you can squish it.
