00:54:11.960 --> 00:54:16.240
 And so that's going to return whether it's a bird or not

00:54:16.240 --> 00:54:19.880
 as a string, whether it's a bird or not as an integer,

00:54:19.880 --> 00:54:23.480
 and the probability that it's a nonbird or a bird.

00:54:23.480 --> 00:54:27.720
 And so that's why we can print these things out.

00:54:27.720 --> 00:54:28.880
 OK.

00:54:28.880 --> 00:54:37.920
 So that's how we can create a computer vision model.
