01:05:12.360 --> 01:05:15.080
 And a fragment just being, so this is a slide that's a fragment.

01:05:15.080 --> 01:05:20.280
 So if I do that, you see it starts with a slide.

01:05:20.280 --> 01:05:21.640
 And then the fragment gets added in.

01:05:25.120 --> 01:05:26.520
 Yeah, that's about all theories too.

01:05:26.520 --> 01:05:27.840
 Actually, it's pretty great.

01:05:27.840 --> 01:05:29.760
 And it's very well documented.

01:05:29.760 --> 01:05:34.000
 I'll just mention what do I make with Jupyter Notebooks?
