00:52:58.960 --> 00:53:00.960
 and what it was originally trained for.

00:53:00.960 --> 00:53:03.200
 That's called fine tuning.

00:53:03.200 --> 00:53:05.240
 Hence the name.

00:53:05.240 --> 00:53:09.760
 So that's why you'll see this downloading happen first.

00:53:09.760 --> 00:53:12.240
 And so as you can see, at the end of it,

00:53:12.240 --> 00:53:13.680
 this is the error rate here.

00:53:13.680 --> 00:53:21.560
 After a few seconds, it's 100% accurate.
