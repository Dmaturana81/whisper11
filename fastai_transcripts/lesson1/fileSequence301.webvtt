01:15:12.400 --> 01:15:16.000
 We need some mechanism if making a little bit better.

01:15:16.000 --> 01:15:19.680
 If we can just do that one thing, then we just

01:15:19.680 --> 01:15:21.600
 need to iterate this a few times.

01:15:21.600 --> 01:15:24.200
 Because each time we put in some more inputs

01:15:24.200 --> 01:15:27.040
 and put in our weights and get our loss

01:15:27.040 --> 01:15:29.240
 and use it to make it a little bit better,

01:15:29.240 --> 01:15:32.000
 then if we make it a little bit better enough times,
