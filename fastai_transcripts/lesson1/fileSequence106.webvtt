00:26:29.560 --> 00:26:31.000
 the features it can find are.

00:26:31.000 --> 00:26:33.080
 And so you can imagine that trying to code these things

00:26:33.080 --> 00:26:37.040
 by hand would be insanely difficult

00:26:37.040 --> 00:26:40.280
 and you wouldn't know even what to encode by hand.

00:26:40.280 --> 00:26:44.440
 So what we're going to learn is how neural networks do this

00:26:44.440 --> 00:26:45.480
 automatically.
