00:59:14.960 --> 00:59:16.840
 to what we have before.

00:59:16.840 --> 00:59:17.880
 A couple of new things.

00:59:17.880 --> 00:59:21.120
 We have to tell it which of the columns are categorical.

00:59:21.120 --> 00:59:23.600
 So they can only take one of a few values

00:59:23.600 --> 00:59:25.680
 and which ones are continuous.

00:59:25.680 --> 00:59:30.000
 So they can take basically any real number.
