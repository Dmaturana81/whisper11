00:04:14.320 --> 00:04:16.560
 And if you try and train a model with broken images,

00:04:16.560 --> 00:04:18.240
 it will not work.

00:04:18.240 --> 00:04:21.560
 So here's something which just verifies each image and unlinks.

00:04:21.560 --> 00:04:25.280
 So it's the ones that don't work.

00:04:25.280 --> 00:04:30.480
 OK, so now we can create what's called a data block.
