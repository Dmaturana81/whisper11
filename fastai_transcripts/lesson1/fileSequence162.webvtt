00:40:24.320 --> 00:40:30.320
 we have image to thumb and so forth.

00:40:30.320 --> 00:40:36.000
 So I always like to view, as I'm building a model,

00:40:36.000 --> 00:40:37.600
 my data at every step.

00:40:37.600 --> 00:40:40.680
 So that's why I first of all grab one bird.

00:40:40.680 --> 00:40:43.120
 And then I grab one forest photo,

00:40:43.120 --> 00:40:46.480
 and I look at them to make sure they look reasonable.
