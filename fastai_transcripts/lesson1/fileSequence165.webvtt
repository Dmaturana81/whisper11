00:41:12.920 --> 00:41:17.520
 One other fast thing I think I'm using here is resize images.

00:41:17.520 --> 00:41:20.520
 You generally will find that for computer vision algorithms,

00:41:20.520 --> 00:41:23.240
 you don't need particularly big images.

00:41:23.240 --> 00:41:27.880
 So I'm resizing these to a maximum size length of 400,

00:41:27.880 --> 00:41:30.520
 because it's actually much faster.
