 I think the 2016 course, if I remember correctly.

00:21:15.040 --> 00:21:17.320

00:21:17.320 --> 00:21:21.360
 been teaching this course since version one.

00:21:21.360 --> 00:21:23.600
 And this is actually the, I think this

00:21:23.600 --> 00:21:26.320
 is the very first version of it, which even back then

00:21:26.320 --> 00:21:27.760
 was getting HBR's attention.
