00:47:13.080 --> 00:47:17.560
 Data loaders are the things that actually PyTorch iterates

00:47:17.560 --> 00:47:21.000
 through to grab a bunch of your data at a time.

00:47:21.000 --> 00:47:24.720
 The way it can do it so fast is by using a GPU, which

00:47:24.720 --> 00:47:28.040
 is something that can do thousands of things at the same time.

00:47:28.040 --> 00:47:30.160
 And that means it needs thousands of things to do
