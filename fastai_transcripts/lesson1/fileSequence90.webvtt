00:22:28.880 --> 00:22:36.360
 Why are we able to create a bird recognizer in a minute or two?

00:22:36.360 --> 00:22:39.040
 And why couldn't we do it before?

00:22:39.040 --> 00:22:41.360
 So I'm going to go back to 2012.

00:22:41.360 --> 00:22:46.280
 And in 2012, this was how image recognition was done.
