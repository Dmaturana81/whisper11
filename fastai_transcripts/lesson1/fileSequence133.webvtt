00:33:13.120 --> 00:33:15.840
 we'll be seeing more and more pure PyTorch

00:33:15.840 --> 00:33:18.440
 as we get deeper and deeper underneath

00:33:18.440 --> 00:33:22.320
 to see exactly how things work.

00:33:22.320 --> 00:33:25.920
 The Fast.AI library just won the 2020 Best Paper Award,

00:33:25.920 --> 00:33:28.520
 or the paper about it, in information.

00:33:28.520 --> 00:33:34.400
 So again, you can see it's very well regarded library.
