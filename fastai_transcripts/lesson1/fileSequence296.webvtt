01:13:59.000 --> 01:14:02.080
 is he said, OK, let's take the inputs and the weights,

01:14:02.080 --> 01:14:03.280
 put them through our model.

01:14:03.280 --> 01:14:05.240
 He wasn't talking particularly about neural networks.

01:14:05.240 --> 01:14:09.480
 He's just like, whatever model you like.

01:14:09.480 --> 01:14:11.960
 Get the results.

01:14:11.960 --> 01:14:15.080
 And then let's decide how good they are.
