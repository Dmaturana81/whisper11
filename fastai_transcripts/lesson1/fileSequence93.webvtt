00:23:13.040 --> 00:23:15.080
 And I asked her why they didn't use deep learning.

00:23:15.080 --> 00:23:19.200
 And she said, well, it wasn't really on the radar at that point.

00:23:19.200 --> 00:23:22.880
 So this is like a free deep learning approach.

00:23:22.880 --> 00:23:25.200
 And so the way they did this was they

00:23:25.200 --> 00:23:28.160
 got a big team of mathematicians and computer scientists

00:23:28.160 --> 00:23:30.040
 and pathologists and so forth to get together
