 Fast.AI is a library we built on top of PyTorch.

00:32:02.360 --> 00:32:06.200
 This huge difference is not because PyTorch is bad.

00:32:06.200 --> 00:32:09.960
 It's because PyTorch is designed to be a strong foundation

00:32:09.960 --> 00:32:13.520
 to build things on top of, like Fast.AI.

00:32:13.520 --> 00:32:18.520
 So when you use Fast.AI, the library,
