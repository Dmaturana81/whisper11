00:46:26.920 --> 00:46:33.200
 And then finally, most computer vision architectures

00:46:33.200 --> 00:46:37.360
 need all of your inputs as you train to be the same size.

00:46:37.360 --> 00:46:42.320
 So item transforms are all of the bits of code

00:46:42.320 --> 00:46:46.600
 that are going to run on every item, on every image in this case.
