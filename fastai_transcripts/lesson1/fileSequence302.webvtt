01:15:29.240 --> 01:15:32.000
 then if we make it a little bit better enough times,

01:15:32.000 --> 01:15:35.560
 eventually it's going to get good, assuming

01:15:35.560 --> 01:15:38.880
 that our model is flexible enough to represent

01:15:38.880 --> 01:15:40.960
 the thing we want to do.

01:15:40.960 --> 01:15:43.560
 Now remember what I told you earlier about what a neural network

01:15:43.560 --> 01:15:45.840
 is, which is basically multiplying things together
