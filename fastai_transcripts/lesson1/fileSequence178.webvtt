00:44:28.640 --> 00:44:31.320
 So the first thing that we tell Fast.DI

00:44:31.320 --> 00:44:34.160
 is what kind of input do we have?

00:44:34.160 --> 00:44:36.960
 And so there are lots of blocks in Fast.DI

00:44:36.960 --> 00:44:38.160
 for different kinds of inputs.

00:44:38.160 --> 00:44:41.120
 So we said, oh, the input is an image.

00:44:41.120 --> 00:44:42.400
 What kind of output is there?

00:44:42.400 --> 00:44:43.280
 What kind of label?

00:44:43.280 --> 00:44:44.640
 The outputs are category.

00:44:44.640 --> 00:44:49.360
 So that means it's one of a number of possibilities.
