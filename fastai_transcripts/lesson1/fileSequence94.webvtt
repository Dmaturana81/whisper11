00:23:28.160 --> 00:23:30.040
 and pathologists and so forth to get together

00:23:30.040 --> 00:23:32.080
 and build these ideas for features,

00:23:32.080 --> 00:23:36.280
 like relationships between epithelial and nuclear neighbors.

00:23:36.280 --> 00:23:38.560
 Thousands and thousands, actually, they created a feature.

00:23:38.560 --> 00:23:41.440
 And each one required a lot of expertise

00:23:41.440 --> 00:23:44.440
 from a cross disciplinary group of experts at Stanford.

00:23:44.440 --> 00:23:47.520
 So this project took years and a lot of people
