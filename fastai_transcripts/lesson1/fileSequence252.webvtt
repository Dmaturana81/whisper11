01:02:58.640 --> 01:03:00.400
 And so again, you can see ShowBatch.

01:03:00.400 --> 01:03:01.320
 So use ShowBatch.

01:03:01.320 --> 01:03:05.080
 You should get back some useful visualization of your data

01:03:05.080 --> 01:03:06.800
 regardless of what kind of data it is.

01:03:10.560 --> 01:03:14.480
 And so again, we create a learner.

01:03:14.480 --> 01:03:16.680
 This time it's a collaborative filtering learner.
