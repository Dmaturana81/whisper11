00:55:24.320 --> 00:55:30.440
 blue as fences, I guess, red as buildings, or brown.

00:55:30.440 --> 00:55:33.440
 And so on the left here, some photos

00:55:33.440 --> 00:55:36.200
 that somebody has already gone through

00:55:36.200 --> 00:55:39.440
 and classified every pixel of every one of these images,

00:55:39.440 --> 00:55:43.040
 according to what that pixel is a pixel of.

00:55:43.040 --> 00:55:49.440
 And then on the right is what our model is guessing.
