00:19:58.880 --> 00:20:01.720
 has been globally recognized, such as our wind

00:20:01.720 --> 00:20:04.560
 in the Dawnbench competition, which

00:20:04.560 --> 00:20:08.840
 showed how we could train big neural networks faster

00:20:08.840 --> 00:20:10.480

 And so that was a really big step in 2018, which actually
