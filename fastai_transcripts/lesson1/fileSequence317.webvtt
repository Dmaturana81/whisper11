01:19:09.560 --> 01:19:15.880
 And so experimenting could be as simple as just running

01:19:15.880 --> 01:19:21.600
 those cackle notebooks that I've shown you just to see them run.

01:19:21.600 --> 01:19:23.240
 You could try changing things a little bit.

01:19:23.240 --> 01:19:27.440
 I'd really love you to try doing the bird or forest exercise,

01:19:27.440 --> 01:19:29.360
 but come up with something else.

01:19:29.360 --> 01:19:32.760
 Maybe try to use three or four categories, rather than two.
