00:30:57.280 --> 00:31:00.760
 researchers, the majority have now shifted to PyTorch.

00:31:00.760 --> 00:31:04.440
 And I mentioned this because what people use in research

00:31:04.440 --> 00:31:06.960
 is a very strong leading indicator of what's

00:31:06.960 --> 00:31:08.600
 going to happen in industry, because this

00:31:08.600 --> 00:31:11.360
 is where all the new algorithms are going to come out.

00:31:11.360 --> 00:31:14.200
 This is where all the papers are going to be written about.

00:31:14.200 --> 00:31:18.640
 It's going to be increasingly difficult to use TensorFlow.
