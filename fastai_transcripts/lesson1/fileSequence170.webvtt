00:42:28.120 --> 00:42:30.160
 the deep learning as community has found

00:42:30.160 --> 00:42:36.640
 a reasonably small number of types of model that work

00:42:36.640 --> 00:42:40.360
 for nearly all the main applications you'll need.

00:42:40.360 --> 00:42:44.720
 And first, I will create the right type of model for you,

00:42:44.720 --> 00:42:47.080
 the vast majority of the time.
