00:28:14.320 --> 00:28:18.040
 So the clicks became dots and the movements became lines.

00:28:18.040 --> 00:28:20.680
 And the speed of the movement became colors.

00:28:20.680 --> 00:28:23.680
 And then use that to create an image classifier.

00:28:23.680 --> 00:28:28.760
 So you can see with some creativity,

00:28:28.760 --> 00:28:33.760
 there's a lot of things you can do with images.
